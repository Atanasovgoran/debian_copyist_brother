Where are drivers?
==================

CUPS and LPR drivers
--------------------

There is three places for printing drivers:

* ~~[DCP, FAX, HL, MFC printer driver download page](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html)~~ ([web archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319074031/http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html));
* ~~[PT, QL, PJ, TD printer driver download page](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_esp.html)~~ ([web archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319074031/http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_esp.html));
* ~~[PC-FAX driver download page](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_pcf.html)~~ ([web archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319074953/http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_pcf.html)).

Some drivers are PPD files or cupswrapper written in C-Shell language, they can be considered as source (see the [“where are sources?” page](where_are_sources.md)).

Some drivers are duplicated for [SI unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Unit) (_mm_) or [Imperial units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units) (_inch_), see the ~~[TD-2020](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_esp.html#TD-2020)~~ ([web archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319074953/http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_esp.html#TD-2020)) for example.

Some Fax drivers are modem driver (_FAX-modem_), some other fax drivers are cupswrapper and LPR drivers (_PC-FAX_). Thoses ones are handled as printers.
