Where are drivers?
==================

CUPS and LPR drivers
--------------------

There is two places for printing drivers:

* [DCP, FAX, HL, MFC printer driver download page](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html);
* [PT, QL, PJ, TD printer driver download page](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_esp.html);
* [PC-FAX driver download page](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_pcf.html).

Some drivers are PPD files or cupswrapper written in C-Shell language, they can be considered as source (see the [“where are sources?” page](where_are_sources.md).

Some drivers are duplicated for [SI unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Unit) (_mm_) or [Imperial units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units) (_inch_), see the [TD-2020](welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_esp.html#TD-2020) for example.

Some Fax drivers are modem driver (_FAX-modem_), some other fax drivers are cupswrapper and LPR wrapper (_PC-FAX_).
