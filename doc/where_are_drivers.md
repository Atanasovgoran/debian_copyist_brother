Where are drivers?
==================

CUPS and LPR drivers
--------------------

There is three places for printing drivers:

* ~~[DCP, FAX, HL, MFC printer driver download page](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html)~~ [(web archive)](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319074031/http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html);
* ~~[PT, QL, PJ, TD printer driver download page](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_esp.html)~~ [(web archive)](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319074031/http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_esp.html);
* ~~[PC-FAX driver download page](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_pcf.html)~~ [(web archive)](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319074953/http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_pcf.html).

Some drivers are PPD files or cupswrapper written in C-Shell language, they can be considered as source (see the [“where are sources?” page](where_are_sources.md)).

Some drivers are duplicated for [SI unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Unit) (_mm_) or [Imperial units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units) (_inch_), see the ~~[TD-2020](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_esp.html#TD-2020)~~ [(web archive)](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319074953/http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_esp.html#TD-2020) for example.

Some Fax drivers are modem driver (_FAX-modem_), some other fax drivers are cupswrapper and LPR drivers (_PC-FAX_). Those ones are handled as printers.

On the new Brother™ web site, we can find PPDs that are not referenced on the old pages, like the [BRP7000E_GPL.PPD [gz]](http://download.brother.com/welcome/dlf006046/BRP7000E_GPL.PPD.gz) on [this page](http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadhowto.aspx?c=us_ot&lang=en&prod=hls7000dn_us_eu_as&os=128&dlid=dlf006046_000&flang=4&type3=562).
