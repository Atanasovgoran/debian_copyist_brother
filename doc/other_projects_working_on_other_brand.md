Other projects working on other brands
--------------------------------------

Those guys are doing similar effort for other brands:

* [The Samsung Unified Linux Driver Repository](http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/)

> This site provides an apt (.deb) repository for installing the Samsung Unified Linux Driver in a more user-friendly and less problematic way than downloading and installing directly from the Samsung website or using the installer that ships with printers. I simply repackage the drivers that Samsung provides for free, and am not involved in any way with development of them. The drivers are binary-only (no source code provided), and are only available for the Intel/AMD 32- and 64-bit platforms with limited ARM support (Android, Raspberry Pi, etc. only if "soft-float"). 

* [Epsonâ„¢ EPL Debian Installer](https://github.com/illwieckz/epsonepl_debian_installer)

> This tool download epsonepl free driver from SourceForge.net then compile it and build a Debian package using checkinstall.
