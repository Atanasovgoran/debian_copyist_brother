Cohabitation issues
===================

On the [“Before the installation” page](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/before.html#evlenv), we can read:

> Connecting more than one machine with the same model number is not supported.

This is not supported, but is this functionnal neverthless?

There is 391 printer models supported on the [Printer binary driver download page](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html), is various drivers of different models can be installed simultaneously?

For information, for both printers, scanners and pcfaxes product, there is 765 Debian-compatible drivers package (699 `.deb`, 66 lonely `.ppd`).

* Can we install one driver next to the other drivers without risk?
* Is some driver package share same binary (like `rawtobr3` or `braddprinter`) with different (newer) and probably incompatible versions?
